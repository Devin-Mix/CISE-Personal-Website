            About Me
        </h1>
        <p>
            My name is Devin Mix. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Florida studying computer science through the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering. My primary career goal is to work in the field of cybersecurity, particularly in a red team position. I currently am neither employed by nor interning at any company.
        </p>
        <p>
            During my time at UF, I have worked to tailor my degree to a career in cybersecurity. I have taken the courses CAP4136 - Malware Reverse Engineering and CIS4204 - Penetration Testing and engaged intensively with their course contents. Both of these courses were taken with <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jnw/">Dr. Joseph Wilson</a>, an instructor whose real-world experience with both courses' topics provided me with an excellent foothold to a future career in the field. In future semesters, I will be taking the courses CIS4360 - Computer and Information Security with <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/resch-cheryl/">Cheryl Resch</a> and CIS4930 - Cyber-Physical System Security with <a href="https://sararampazzi.com/">Dr. Sara Rampazzi</a>. Through both of these opportunities, I hope to expand upon my existing skillset and improve my cybersecurity capabilities beyond the academic sphere. Likewise, I plan on engaging with the UF Student Infosec Team to learn new techniques for the safe management of information in the modern era.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the extracurricular level, I am deeply involved with the University of Florida Honors Program. Throughout my entire time at UF, I have been involved with Honor Chords, the official acapella group of UF Honors. I began as a member in my freshman year before transitioning to an officer position as secretary and treasurer during my sophomore year. I was later elected as president of the group for my junior year and will continue to fulfill that role until my graduation in Spring of 2023. Honor Chords has provided me with the opportunity to engage with the arts outside of the classroom setting and connected me to a vast network of students and alumni in all parts of the world, both of which are perks which I have greatly appreciated.
        </p> 
        <p>
            I have also been actively engaged with the UF Student Honors Organization (SHO), in which I fulfilled the roles of board member, secretary, and vice president of internal affairs during my freshman, sophomore, and junior years, respectively. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I did not elect to continue as a member during my senior year. Regardless, SHO's network is similarly vast, and the numerous opportunites which it provided to engage with the broader Honors community were unmatched by any other organization on campus.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time, I am deeply passionate about music. I play guitar, with a repertoire primarily rooted in 2000s and 2010s pop-punk. I am a CD collector, and actively work to archive my finds from concerts, record stores, and resale shops alike in ALAC format. I also am working to build a movie collection on DVD or Blu-Ray, albeit at a somewhat slow rate. I am a fan of audio-visual gear as well, and can be frequently heard ranting to my friends about different speakers, amps, DACs, and more.

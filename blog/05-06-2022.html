            Hello.
        </p>
        <p>
            My name is Devin Mix. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Florida studying computer science through the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering. My primary career goal is to work in the field of cybersecurity, particularly in a red team position, and my coursework thus far reflects this aim. At the time of writing, I am neither employed by nor interning at any company.
        </p>
        <p>
            This blog is intended to be a space for me to journal my thoughts about computer science, my education, my hobbies, the world in general, or pretty much anything else which I feel compelled to write about on a given day. It is not intended to serve as a professional correspondance, though I welcome its use as a sample of my personality outside the classroom or workplace. The views expressed here are entirely my own, and are not a reflection of the views of my university nor any current or future employer of me. Unless otherwise stated, all content on this website should be assumed to be of my own creation and ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
            Expect something of a flurry of activity on this website in the coming days as I attempt to better identify what its purpose and identity will be. I already have several topics in mind which I would like to discuss in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>

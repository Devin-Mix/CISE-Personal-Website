        </p>
        <p>Six months and eight days ago I started this blog. Ten days after that, I contributed to it. Since then, I have contributed nothing to it.</p>
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
    
    <p>Unfortunately, I came to a realization. Surprisingly enough, making high-effort content takes a high amount of effort, and effort is a finite resource. I wanted to make something that would be <i>viral</i>, but I failed to recognize that virality comes with a <i>reason.</i></p><p>I made some lofty promises in that first blog post that I couldn't have hoped to keep. I was inspired by Hacker News blog posts and a myriad of links telling me to start a personal site. I thought it would be a fun side project and a way of sharing my thoughts with the world.</p><p>In some ways, the first true, non-introductory post that I contributed here was prescient. In late August of this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hbo-max-to-remove-36-titles-from-streaming-residual-payouts">HBO Max removed several high-profile titles</a> from its service in the name of tax write-offs, not the least of which to me was J. G. Quintel's adult-oriented animated sitcom <i>Close Enough</i>, which was among the reasons that I joined the service in the first place. Still, the reality of the situation is somewhat irrelevant; my post about Netflix was rooted primarily in suspicion and the writings of others rather than evidence or internal konwledge. I wasn't qualified to speak to the subject matter.</p><p>I intend to change that in the future. There are things that I want to write about that I feel are important to share, even if not for everyone. There are subjects that I feel qualified to discuss, even if they are small in scale. This is a personal website, and I intend to make it personal.</p><footer>

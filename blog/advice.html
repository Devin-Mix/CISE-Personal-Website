        <p>
            <i>November 15, 2022</i> - UF is an SEC school. Football is huge, and campus effectively closes on Saturdays in the Fall. This includes the libraries and gyms after a certain point. If you want to get things done on the weekend, bear in mind that game day will make it much more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>November 15, 2022</i> - Use the campus gyms. They are free and have great equipment. Walking around campus will help keep your health up, but having free access to excellent workout equipment is a great way to keep your strength and stamina up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>November 15, 2022</i> - Wear sunscreen. The Florida sun is brutal. You will sunburn, regardless of the month. At minimum, have a sunscreen for your face. Ideally though, putting something on the rest of your body and reapplying throughout the day will do wonders for your skin's health. Trust me on this one.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>November 15, 2022</i> - Go to class. You pay for your lectures. Take advantage of them. Zoom recordings are accessible, yes, but there is a lot lost in not being able to ask questions as you go along. Plus, classes are great places to meet new people who could become group project partners or even friends.

<a id="why"><h2>Okay, but like... why?</h2></a>
<p>Well, if you really want answers, then I suppose an explanation is in order.</p>
<a id="hi"><h3>Hi.</h3></a>
<p>My name is Devin Mix. I am not a researcher. I am not a professor. At the time of writing, I am not even employed. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Florida studying computer science through the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering. In general, the facts listed above do not pertain to matters in which I would be considered credible. However, thanks to the grace of the UF CISE department, I am able to host them on a webpage with a .edu suffix.</p>
<a id="background"><h3>Why I did it</h3></a>
<p>Before we get into that, I feel as though a bit of background is needed.</p>
<p>Prior to attending UF, I spent 12 years (plus kindergarten) as a proud member of the United States public school system. I split my time between a series of small, underfunded, rural schools in Connecticut during my childhood and two suburban, modestly sized, yet equally underfunded schools in Southwest Florida during my teenage years. Throughout this time, I was placed into a number of programs which served to provide an "enhanced" academic experience: special projects, advanced classes, gifted programs, AP classes, IB curriculums, and so on. I take little to no pride in having been involved in these programs, and in many ways I'm critical of them to this day, but I mention them here to illustrate that I have experience with some of the more ambitious opportunities that US public schools have to offer.</p>
<p>In reflecting on my time in grade school, one thing stands out to me: at no point was I taught how to do research. More specifically, I was never taught how to do <i>good</i> research. Sure, my high school classes made something of an effort to make us write papers, (particularly the IB classes that required them,) but oftentimes the way in which we were intended to gather information failed to involve anything more than "Go read a book." Which brings me to my next point...</p>
<a id="gold"><h3>The Gold Standard</h3></a>
<p>.org, .gov, and .edu. Throughout my time in grade school, these three top-level domains were drilled into my head as the gold standard of internet research. Oftentimes, they were simply stated to be credible sources by the authority figures at hand, whether that be a teacher, an advisor on a paper, or some guest speaker. On rare occasions, certain teachers would even go so far as to outright require their presence in the works cited page of a paper in order to receive a passing grade. Rarely, if ever, was consideration given to the content or authors of those sources. Instead, their credibility was intrinsically tied to four little characters in the address bar of a Chromebook.</p>
<p>To the credit of the schools, this approach is valid in certain contexts. In the modern world, where grade school research is a digital affair and books languish on the shelves of libraries nationwide, a basic understanding of what can be considered true on the internet is less of an optional skill and moreso a vital component of the online lifestyle. Teaching students, especially those in the earliest stages of their researching endeavors, to consider the origins of their sources rather than accepting all claims at face value is an excellent first step in developing the critical thinking capacity of an impressionable population.</p>
<p>Where the public school system comes up short is in its failure to further elaborate on <i>why</i> these sources are credible. Little to no mention is given, for example, of the (relative) lack of authorial bias in governments, the review process of scientific journals, or the philanthropic aims of NGOs. Instead, the "intrinsic good" hypothesis persists right up until graduation, leaving an entire population of students woefully unprepared to critically evaluate the content they see online.</p>
<a id="problem"><h3>Why this is a problem</h3></a>
<p>Put simply, the internet is always changing. Twenty to thirty years ago, before the rise of massive conglomerate sites and online corporate agendas, perhaps putting blind faith in the holy trifecta would have left one with a nuanced and fair perspective on the world. This is not the world that we live in today.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the trifecta seems to be little more than a false god. Governments lie, censor, and alter the information they broadcast to the world to better align with their administrative aims. Universities, their faculty, and their guest speakers on every corner and side of the political compass share material that pushes all sorts of agendas. Perhaps most notably, anybody with $10 to spend on their favorite domain registration service can be the proud owner of a .org site and broadcast their personal ideology to their heart's content.</p>
<p>Yet, for all that the internet has evolved, our way of teaching it has not. Millions of students graduate high school each year with a diploma that says nothing of their ability to think critically on the modern internet. As such, we stand face-to-face with the death of expertise in the modern world, in which the facts of everything from public health to American democracy come secondary to the way in which they are presented online. Conspiracy theories have taken root everywhere from Facebook to Congress, tribalism is at an all-time high, and the worst seems possible at any given moment. Worst of all, we knew this was coming. The writing was on the wall, (as, for instance, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13510591">this</a> Hacker News comment from five years ago indicates,) but in all of our infinite wisdom, we have failed to stop this outcome.</p>
<a id="solution"><h3>So what's the solution?</h3></a>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>And that's a scary thing to admit.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that we can uniformly change how we teach students to evaluate sources online. Above all else, this would serve to equip them to handle the current situation and perhaps move towards mitigating it. Unfortunately, the means of enacting such a change remain hidden away behind an increasingly politicized system of public school governance that sees any deviation from the current norms as an affront to society as a whole. Paradoxically, equipping those same individuals that so vehemently reject improving the critical thinking skills of students with the very skills which they push back against may enable them to examine the literature that supports such a change. Alas, many stand firm in their values, and without the authority of an instructor to critique their information sources, enacting change through them is a lost cause.</p>
<p>Parents are equally as unlikely to be of aid. While conversations with young children regarding online credibility may help them later in life, there is an unfortunate trend among parents to push onto their children the same willful ignorance which they enjoy themselves. Children are heavily influenced by their home environment, and if that environment emphasizes seeking information from a specific subset of biased resources, the apple unfortunately does not fall far from the tree.</p>
<p>As such, we come to the final glimmer of hope in this sea of darkness: teachers. While the opportunity to seek credible information online may not be provided to all students in a uniform manner, teachers are uniquely positioned as the primary vector of such an opportunity to their students. Armed with the capability of telling a student that a source is or is not credible <i>and</i> providing consequences for a failure to acknowledge when it isn't, teachers have the power to not only support students' capability to think critically online, but to actively enforce their usage of their source analysis skills.</p>
<p>There is, of course, an unfortunate implication of this responsibility for certain teachers: requiring students to analyze the credibility of their sources also requires analyzing them yourself. Fundamentally, the student can only be taught from the teacher what the teacher knows, meaning the teacher themselves must work to evaluate sources in the same way as the student. Put simply, checkboxes for .org, .gov, and .edu just aren't going to cut it.</p>
<a id="summary"><h3>Back to the website</h3></a>
<p><b>Q:</b> So why did I make the Incredible Website?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> It's a joke.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>In case you haven't realized, the facts above are incredible in the sense that they aren't verified. There is no peer-reviewed journal that says the moon is made of cheese, nor am I an individual to whom you should be turning for answers on whether it is.</p>
<p>What matters is the domain. ufl.edu. You're reading this page on a UF-hosted website, and it contains facts that would cause anyone to raise an eyebrow. Yet, in spite of this, I could put anything on this website for you, you could cite it in a paper, and there is a non-zero chance that a public school teacher would blindly accept it as appropriate. The Incredible Website stands as living proof that evaluating credibility requires more than just four characters in an address bar.</p>
<hr>
<a id="qna"><h2>I have a few questions...</h2></a>
<h3>Can I cite this page?</h3>
<p>Sure. You can. But you shouldn't.</p>
<p>If you want to cite this page, you're missing the point. I am not credible. This page is not credible. The facts are not credible, and even the long part above is not credible. No part of this page is credible, and citing it will subsequently undermine the credibility of whatever project it is that you're working on. I take no responsibility for the consequences of doing so.</p>
<p>The one exception is if you are citing its existence as proof that .edu sites are not inherently trustworthy. In that case, go right ahead. You understood the point of it.</p>
<h3>I am a teacher and one of my students cited this page. What should I do?</h3>
<p>That depends. What were they citing? If they cited the facts or my writing, they missed the point of the page. If they cited it as evidence that a domain does not indicate trustworthiness, they might have done something right.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what's appropriate for their situation, but my general rule is that if they're citing the facts just to be funny, they're probably missing the point.</p>
